The system shall:

- Provide user interfaces for mobile (Android/IOS), web, SMS, and IVR channels to allow users to register, login, view account details, and manage their account
- Integrate with various backend systems including MW, AOM, Kafka, SF, Oracle DB, OCS, and VoltDB to enable user account management, billing, and tariff functionalities
- Utilize Kafka and SF for data transmission between systems
- Leverage VoltDB to store and retrieve user account data including tariffs, usage, and remaining balances
- Use Oracle DB as the system of record for user, product, and billing data
- Employ OCS for real-time usage tracking, tariff management, and billing 
- Have test suites implemented covering functionality, performance, reliability, and data integrity for mobile apps, backends systems, and interfaces

The system architecture shall: 

- Consist of decoupled front-end channels, middleware, and backend data and processing systems
- Enable asynchronous near real-time data flow between systems using Kafka messaging
- Maintain data consistency across backends using Oracle DB as the source of truth

Key functional requirements include:

- User self sign-up and login across channels
- Real-time account usage tracking and balance deduction
- Configurable tariff plans and rate management
- Querying of remaining balances and usage
- Secure storage of user credentials and account data
- Reliable failover and recovery mechanisms
